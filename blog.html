              <h3>What is blog?</h3>
              <p>Blogs are a type of regularly updated websites that provide insight into a certain topic. The word blog
                is a combined version of the words “web” and “log.” At their inception, blogs were simply an online
                diary where people could keep a log about their daily lives on the web.</p>

              <br>
              <p>ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on
                November 30, 2022. And it is a natural language processing tool driven by AI technology that allows you
                to have human-like conversations and much more with the chatbot. The language model can answer questions
                and assist you with tasks, such as composing emails, essays, and code.OpenAI acknowledges that ChatGPT
                "sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. </p>

              <h3>March 2023 security breach</h3>
              <p>In March 2023, a bug allowed some users to see the titles of other users' conversations. OpenAI CEO Sam
                Altman said that users were unable to see the contents of the conversations. Shortly after the bug was
                fixed, users could not see their conversation history. Later reports showed the bug was much more severe
                than initially believed, with OpenAI reporting that it had leaked users' "first and last name, email
                address, payment address, the last four digits (only) of a credit card number, and credit card
                expiration date".</p>

              <p>A few days before the launch of OpenAI's software developer support service, on February 27, 2023,
                Snapchat rolled out, for its paid Snapchat Plus userbase, a custom ChatGPT chatbot called "My AI"</p>

              <h2>LINKEDIN</h2>
              <br>
              <p><b>LinkedIn's current CEO is Ryan Roslansky. Jeff Weiner, previously CEO of LinkedIn</b>, is now
                serving as the Executive Chairman. Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, is chairman of the board. It was
                funded by Sequoia Capital, Greylock, Bain Capital Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and the European
                Founders Fund. LinkedIn reached profitability in March 2006. Since January 2011 the company had received
                a total of $103 million (~$133 million in 2022) of investment.</p>
              <br>
              <p>LinkedIn is a business and employment-focused social media platform that works through websites and
                mobile apps. It was launched on May 5, 2003. Since December 2016, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary
                of Microsoft. The platform is primarily used for professional networking and career development, and
                allows jobseekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs. From 2015 most of the company's revenue
                came from selling access to information about its members to recruiters and sales professionals.
                LinkedIn has more than 970 million registered members from over 200 countries and territories.</p>
              <br>
              <p>When a user accepts an invitation from another user, they have a first-level connection; the user is
                indirectly connected to the other user's connections with what LinkedIn terms second-level and
                third-level connections.</p>
              <br>
              <b>Phishing</b>
              <br>
              <p>In what is known as Operation Socialist, documents released by Edward Snowden in the 2013 global
                surveillance disclosures revealed that British Government Communications Headquarters (an intelligence
                and security organisation) infiltrated the Belgian telecommunications network Belgacom by luring
                employees to a false LinkedIn page.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In 2022, the company ranked first in a list of brands most likely to be imitated in phishing attempts.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>In August 2023, several Linkedin users were targeted by hackers in hijacking and phishing bid. Users
                were locked out of their accounts and threatened with permanent account deletion if they did not pay a
                ransom.</p>
